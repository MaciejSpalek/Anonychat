## Project Overview 
Anonychat is an application developed in React, used to chat with a randomly selected person. On the main page, just click the button and if you are currently logged in, you will be connected to one. All user actions are sent to the server, which responds to them using the SocketIO library, which allows real-time communication. Redux is responsible for the application status.
